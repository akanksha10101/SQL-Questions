Data Storage:
      View:
      Logical only; no data is stored physically. Only the query definition is saved.
      Materialized view:
      Physical data; the results of the query are stored on disk or in physical memory.

Data Freshness:
      View:
      Always up-to-date; data is fetched from the original tables in real-time when the view is queried.
      Materialized view:
      Stale data; requires a periodic refresh to reflect changes in the underlying tables.

Performance:
      View:
      Slower for complex queries, as the query executes every time the view is accessed.
      Materialized view:
      Faster for complex queries because the results are precomputed and pre-stored.
